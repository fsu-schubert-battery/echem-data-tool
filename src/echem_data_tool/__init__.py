## What this is for?

The **Echem Data Tool** is a comprehensive Python package designed for the management, 
evaluation, and visualization of measurement data from electrochemical experiments. 

### Key Features

- **üìä Data Management**: Import, organize, and manage electrochemical measurement data
- **‚ö° Analysis Tools**: Built-in analysis functions for common electrochemical techniques
- **üìà Visualization**: Create publication-ready plots and charts
- **üß™ Electrochemical Focus**: Specialized tools for battery research and electroanalysis

### Supported Techniques

- Galvanostatic/Potentiostatic measurements
- Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
- Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) experiments
- Battery cycling data
- And more...

# Installation

### For End Users

Install directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install echem-data-tool
```

### Requirements

- **Python**: 3.13 or higher
- **Dependencies**: pandas, xarray, yadg, pycodata
- **Development**: pytest, pdoc (for documentation)

# Quick Start

```python
from echem_data_tool import main
from pycodata import constants_2022 as pc

### Run the main application
main()

# Access physical constants
faraday = pc.FARADAY_CONSTANT['value']  # 96485.33212 C/mol
print(f"Faraday constant: {faraday} C/mol")
```

# Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following modules:

- **`main`**: Main application entry point and demonstration
- Additional modules will be added as the project develops

# Development Status

üöß **Work in Progress**: This project is actively under development.
